Put others under pressure to complete tasks
 Need for control and power
 Compete with everyone
Keep looking out for opportunities to earn money
Attracted to a large and loud  crowd.
I seek attention and love from others
I am humorous
.I am noisy and talkative
I have a problem with criticising others
I value cooperation over competition
I just want everyone to be equal
I hardly appreciate or boast about myself
I am emotionally reserved
Attention to details
I love order and regularity
My first reaction is to list down the flaws of something
